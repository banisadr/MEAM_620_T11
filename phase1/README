1 Trajectory design
===================

  The trajectories were modelled as a polynomial of degree 5 for the
  position. For the circular trajectory, we project the 1-D positions,
  velocities and accelerations given by the polynomial to the desired
  3-D shape. For the diamond, we break the trajectory in 4 legs and the
  velocities and accelerations are made 0 at the end of each leg. The
  only parameter used is the time required to complete the
  trajectory. The desirable trade-off between speed and accuracy may be
  selected by changing the time parameter.


2 Controller design
===================

  We used MATLAB `pidtune' to find the gains. For the attitude
  controller a crossover frequency of 10 Hz and phase margin of 45 deg
  were selected. For the position references a crossover frequency of 1
  Hz and phase margin of 75 deg were selected. The following code was
  used to find the gains that were used in the submission.

  ,----
  | % angular
  | wc = 10*2*pi; % cross over freq (bw)
  | phasemargin = 45;
  | 
  | phi = tf(1, [I(1,1) 0 0]);
  | theta = tf(1, [I(2,2) 0 0]);
  | psi = tf(1, [I(3,3) 0 0]);
  | [C, info] = pidtune(phi, 'pd', wc, pidtuneOptions('PhaseMargin', phasemargin))
  | [C, info] = pidtune(theta, 'pd', wc, pidtuneOptions('PhaseMargin', phasemargin))
  | [C, info] = pidtune(psi, 'pd', wc, pidtuneOptions('PhaseMargin', phasemargin))

  | wc = 1*2*pi; % cross over freq (bw)
  | phasemargin = 75;
  | pos = tf(1, [1 0 0]);
  | [C, info] = pidtune(pos, 'pd', wc, pidtuneOptions('PhaseMargin', phasemargin, ...
  |                                                   'DesignFocus', 'reference-tracking'))

  We tried using LQR to design the controllers but results were not so
  good, probably because the $Q$ and $R$ matrices were not sensible. We
  also attempted to project the position error away from the trajectory
  tangent and to use a nonlinear guidance (using the sines and cosines
  instead of small angle approximations, with the same gains). The
  results didn't change much with these modifications, further
  performance evaluation should be done to assess their effects.
